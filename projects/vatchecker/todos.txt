to do:
   - review code with subroutines, first version was a bit of easyness and lazyness :)
   - check valid length before sending request for each country
   - add U automatically when dealing with Austrian VAT numbers.
   - perform vatnumber check before sending request.
   - config file with vatid.eu ipaddress and port stored, in case the ipaddress changes.
   - build timer in application to avoid long periods to wait (still no problems with this, response is still fast enough).
