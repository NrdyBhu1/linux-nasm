Linux assembly programs


If any assembling errors occure then it could be that your includes folder is badly named or cannot be found.
All this is assembled with NASM version 2.13.2 and linked with GNU ld (GNU Binutils for Ubuntu) 2.30
The NASMENV has to be set.

This repo has examples too but too but in a different branch to keep things clean (and manageable)
